## 🎯 Core Modules

### 1. 🌐 Network Discovery
**Purpose**: Discover live hosts in target networks
**Legal Warning**: Network scanning may constitute unauthorized reconnaissance

**Features**:
- Automatic network interface detection
- Ping sweep scanning with nmap
- ARP scanning for hidden devices
- Quick port scanning of discovered hosts
- Parallel scanning with safety limits

**Usage Example**:
```bash
./main.sh → 1) Network Discovery
# Select network from detected interfaces
# Or enter custom CIDR range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
```

**Authorization Required**: Written permission to scan the target network

### 2. 🔍 Port Scanner
**Purpose**: Detailed port scanning and service detection
**Legal Warning**: Port scanning can be considered illegal reconnaissance

**Scanning Modes**:
- **Fast scan**: Top 1000 ports (quick reconnaissance)
- **Full scan**: All 65535 ports (comprehensive but slow)
- **Stealth scan**: SYN scanning to avoid detection
- **UDP scan**: UDP services detection
- **Version scan**: Service version identification
- **Aggressive scan**: OS detection + scripts + traceroute
- **Tor scan**: Anonymous scanning through Tor
- **Mass scan**: High-speed scanning with masscan

**Usage Example**:
```bash
./main.sh → 2) Port Scanner → 1) Fast scan
# Enter target IP or range
# Example: 192.168.1.100 or 192.168.1.1-100
```

**Authorization Required**: Explicit permission to scan target hosts

### 3. 🛡️ Vulnerability Scanner
**Purpose**: Security vulnerability assessment
**Legal Warning**: Vulnerability scanning may expose sensitive security information

**Assessment Types**:
- **NSE scripts**: Nmap vulnerability scripts
- **Nikto**: Web application vulnerabilities
- **SQLmap**: SQL injection testing
- **SMB vulnerabilities**: Including EternalBlue, MS08-067
- **Weak passwords**: SSH, FTP, Telnet brute force testing
- **Open shares**: SMB/NFS share enumeration
- **SSL/TLS**: Certificate and encryption vulnerabilities

**Usage Example**:
```bash
./main.sh → 3) Vulnerability Scanner → 1) NSE scripts
# Enter target IP address
# Example: 192.168.1.100
```

**Authorization Required**: Written authorization for vulnerability assessment

### 4. 🖥️ System Information
**Purpose**: Comprehensive system reconnaissance
**Legal Warning**: Information gathering may constitute unauthorized access

**Information Collected**:
- System details (OS, kernel, architecture)
- Hardware information (CPU, memory, storage)
- Network configuration (interfaces, routing)
- Security status (firewall, SSH, services)
- Running processes and services
- Connected devices (USB, PCI, Bluetooth)

**Usage Example**:
```bash
./main.sh → 4) System Information → 1) Full system report
```

**Authorization Required**: Permission to gather system information

### 5. ⚔️ Attack Tools
**Purpose**: Active penetration testing
**Legal Warning**: THESE ARE ACTIVE ATTACK TOOLS - EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IF MISUSED

**Attack Categories**:

#### Brute Force Attacks:
- **SSH brute force**: Dictionary attacks against SSH
- **FTP brute force**: Password attacks against FTP
- **HTTP brute force**: Basic authentication attacks
- **Telnet brute force**: Telnet service attacks
- **RDP brute force**: Remote Desktop attacks

#### Network Attacks:
- **DoS attacks**: TCP SYN flood attacks
- **ARP spoofing**: Man-in-the-middle positioning
- **MITM attacks**: Traffic interception via ettercap

#### WiFi Attacks:
- **Handshake capture**: WPA/WPA2 handshake collection
- **Deauth attacks**: Wireless deauthentication

#### Other Tools:
- **Directory enumeration**: Web directory/file discovery
- **Wordlist generation**: Custom password dictionaries
- **Malicious file generation**: Payload creation

**Usage Example**:
```bash
./main.sh → 5) Attack Tools → 1) SSH brute force
# WARNING PROMPTS WILL APPEAR
# Enter target IP address
# Select attack mode
```

**Authorization Required**: EXPLICIT WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FOR ACTIVE ATTACKS
